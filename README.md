# Neural-Net-in-Assembly

Implemented a simple Artificial Neural Net (ANN), which will be able to classify handwritten digits to their actual number. As inputs, I used the MNIST data set, which is a dataset of 60,000 examples presented as images sized 28x28 = 784 pixels. These contain handwritten digits ranging from 0-9. The network will then return a number representing the digit in the image.
